# EventFlowHub

EventFlowHub is an event-driven microservices project that I'm building using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2.2, Kafka, and ELK stack. 
It efficiently processes and analyzes event data from various sources, providing a scalable and real-time architecture.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Will use Kafka for seamless event-driven communication between microservices.
- **Java Spring Boot Microservices:** Modular and scalable microservices architecture for better maintainability.
- **ELK Stack Integration:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana integration for powerful event data analytics and visualization.
- **Scalability:** Will be designed to handle high-throughput event streams with ease.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Apache Kafka
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### Installation
